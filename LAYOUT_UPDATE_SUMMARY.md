## ✅ Successfully Updated Student Home Page Layout

### Changes Made:

1. **Moved Logout Button Inline**: The logout button is now part of the main button grid alongside the other navigation buttons.

2. **Removed Separate Logout Section**: Eliminated the separate logout container and HR divider that was below the main buttons.

3. **Updated Button Layout**: Now all 5 buttons (Dashboard, View Profile, Edit Profile, Study Resources, Logout) are in the same responsive grid.

4. **Cleaned Up CSS**: Removed all the logout-specific CSS classes that were used for the separate layout (`logout-container`, `logout-center`, etc.).

5. **Updated Animation Delays**: Adjusted the logout button's animation delay to `1000ms` to follow the sequence.

### Current Button Layout:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  Dashboard  │ View Profile│ Edit Profile│
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│Study Resources│   Logout   │             │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

On mobile devices, all buttons will stack vertically for better usability.

### Key Features Maintained:

- ✅ Responsive grid layout that adapts to screen size
- ✅ Consistent button styling and hover effects  
- ✅ Smooth animations with staggered delays
- ✅ Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

### Button Styling:

- **Dashboard**: Blue-teal gradient
- **View Profile**: Blue outline  
- **Edit Profile**: Yellow outline
- **Study Resources**: Green outline
- **Logout**: Red gradient (maintains prominence for important action)

The layout now provides a cleaner, more cohesive design where all navigation options are grouped together logically.
